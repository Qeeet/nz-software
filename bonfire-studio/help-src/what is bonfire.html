Bonfire is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), or simply a text editor, that is aimed to, singlehandedly, replace all of your current editors. Its current functionality allows users to edit XML files, but that functionality will be quickly expanded upon. An SDK will be available for those who wish to contribute and write their own editors, and other users will be able to download new editors/viewers as they are put up on our website.
