There are some problems compiling the demo applications with *some* 
versions of *some* compilers.

Borland C++ Version 4.5x and less : you're unlikely to get the 
demos to compile without editing the source, the include style 
will need to be changed from <include> to <include.h>, probably 
other changes will be required as well.

Borland C++ Version 5.01 and less : Has problems with namespace 
lookups, particularly with iterators that are in a different 
namespaces from the STL.  Some fixes have been introduced to 
fix this in regress.h, they're ugly though.

Borland C++ Version 5.02 : No problems known.

Borland C++ Builder 3 : no problems, as long as you use ILink 
and not TLink32 - the latter isn't really supported by Builder 3 
anyway.

Borland C++ Builder 4 : no known problems.

GCC 2.8: Compiles cleanly but does not run - the compiler 
generates a corrupt jump table for the central switch statement 
of reg_expression::set_expression.  I don't know if this is a 
true compiler problem or a problem with the mingwin32 port, as 
the assembly output from the compiler does in fact look OK.

GCC 2.91 (EGCS 1.11 and later): no known problems - however 
the compiler crashes when used with STLPort rather than SGI STL,
could be STL configure problem in this case as the configure script
for STLPort crashes the egcs compiler also.

GCC 2.95: Some ports crash at run time - the compiler appears to be
generating bad fixups in the executable (Mingwin32 port), confirmed as a
bug in C++ compiler front end, temporary code-fix in place.

Microsoft VC++ 5:  I'm told everything's OK for this compiler - 
provide you update to service pack 3 - but can't check this for myself.

Microsoft VC++ 6:  no known problems.

SunPro v5:  I'm told this works OK, but have been unable to verify this
for myself.

HP aCC:  I'm told this works OK, but have been unable to verify this
for myself.
