Bookmarks are tools that help you set anchors in your text files. You can set a bookmark on any line and go back to it with a simple keyboard shortcut. 
This is useful in large files, to reduce the time to scroll through the whole file to search for the desired line. 
Bookmarks appear as blue circles, on the left margin, with a number inside indicating which bookmark it is. To set a bookmark on a specific line, press Ctrl+#, where # is the number of the bookmark to set. 
To quickly scroll to a specific bookmark, press Alt+#.
