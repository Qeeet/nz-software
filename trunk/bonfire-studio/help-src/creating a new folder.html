To create a new folder, click Project > New Folder. 
You can also right-click on a project or an existing folder in Project Manager 
and click on New Folder. You will see a new element in the Project Tree, labeled 
“NewFolder”. You can rename it to whatever name you wish, as long as the folder 
with that name does not exist already in the given path. The given path is 
determined from the path of the parent node, whether it is a project or another 
folder.
