<p>Project Manager allows you to move any file or folder to another project or even just another folder in the same project.
You can do that by right-clicking on the node you would like to move and choose "Move To" and then click on the project to which you would like to move it to.
You can also move items by dragging the node and dropping it on another project or folder node.</p>
<p><font color="red">NOTE:</font> The files that are moved in the Project Manager also get moved on your hard drive to the new location, whereas the folders do not get physically moved. 
They simply become <a href="virtual folders.html">virtual folders</a> in the Project Manager.</p>
