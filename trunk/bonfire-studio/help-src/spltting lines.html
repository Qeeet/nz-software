When loading any text file, Bonfire Studio will check to make sure that no line contains more than 1024 characters. 
If it finds one, it will prompt you to split the lines, or to cancel opening the file. 
Splitting the lines will add line breaks at the last possible character, without breaking up markup tags (<...>). If you think that this might, in any way, mess up your file, choose to cancel loading of the file, and try to edit it manually.
