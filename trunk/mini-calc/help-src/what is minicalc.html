MiniCalc is a utility which helps users with advanced and tedious calculations. MiniCalc is most
similar to a scientific calculator with extended input functionality; several mathematical
calculations can be done at once to reach a final result. For example, to calculate the celsius
value of the temperature 56&deg;F, one would type:

<ul>5 * (<b>56</b> - 32) / 9 <b>[Enter]</b></ul>

It is also possible to make expression-based functions. To create a fahrenheit-to-celsius function,
and then calculate the celsius temperature of 56&deg;F, one would enter:

<ul>
cel(f) = 5 * (f - 32) / 9 <b>[Enter]</b><br>
cel(56) <b>[Enter]</b><br>
</ul>

MiniCalc would then output the value '<b>13.3333</b>' as the result. For information about the input
