<p>Symbols (variables and functions) are very important in MiniCalc. They
must be created and their values set before they can be used.</p>

<p>The values of variables and the evaluated values of functions can be used in expressions. For example,
to use the result of sin 90 in an expression (adding the value of a variable (x) to its value), one would input
&quot;<font face="courier new">sin(90) + x</font>&quot;. To get the minimum value of two variables (x) and (y),
one would input &quot;<font face="courier new">min(x,y)</font>&quot; and press enter. The result would be
displayed in the output screen.
