MiniCalc is a utility which helps users with advanced and tedious calculations. MiniCalc is most similar to a scientific calculator with extended input functionality; several mathematical calculations can be done at once to reach a final result. For example, to calculate the celsius value of the temperature 56°F, one would type:
{{{
5 * (56 - 32) / 9
}}}
It is also possible to make expression-based functions. To create a fahrenheit-to-celsius function, and then calculate the celsius temperature of 56°F, one would enter:
{{{
cel(f) = 5 * (f - 32) / 9
cel(56)
}}}
MiniCalc would then output the value '13.3333' as the result. For information about the input syntax, click here.
